# gallery2

This is a fork of the now-dormant [gallery2](http://galleryproject.org/) project.  The gallery code was written against PHP 5, and there are some changes in PHP 7 and 8 that were causing problems for me (as well as a bunch of warnings).

Since [#26](https://github.com/gregstoll/gallery2/pull/26) the code supports PHP 8, although it's very possible I've missed some problems; please open an issue if you find anything!

This code is based on gallery2 version 2.3.2 (core version 1.3.0.2)

FYI - Brad Dutton has revived Gallery 3 that is compatible with PHP 7.  I haven't tried it, but you can download it at [galleryrevival.com](http://galleryrevival.com/).
