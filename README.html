    <p>
      Gallery is a web based software product that lets you manage
      your photos on your own website.  You must have your own website
      with PHP and database support in order to install and use it.  With Gallery
      you can easily create and maintain albums of photos via an
      intuitive interface.  Photo management includes automatic
      thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
      captioning, searching and more.  Albums and photos can have
      view, edit, delete and other permissions per individual
      authenticated user for an additional level of privacy.  It's
      great for communities - give accounts to your friends and family
      and let them upload and manage their own photos on your website!

      In preparation of the Gallery 2.3 release, we retained <b>
      <a href="http://www.gdssecurity.com/">Gotham Digital Science</a></b>
      (GDS) to a perform security audit on Gallery 2. They are experts in application security, as
      this is the primary focus of their business.
    </p>

    <p>
      We recognize that hiring external consultants to perform security audits does not guarantee
      that our code is bug-free and by no means un-hackable, but it clearly indicates our
      willingness to perform due diligence to make sure our code is reasonably secure.
      The combination of an <b>external perspective</b> of security experts and the insight of
      internal experts both performing detailed audits is yielding much better results than only
      one of the two perspectives alone.

    <p>
      Over four years of design and development have gone into making
      Gallery 2 the best online photo management product available.
      We have made it easy to add new features while keeping them in
      separate modules so that you can customize it to only have the
      ones that you want.  For those of you who like standards, we
      have strict XHTML compliance but give plenty of power to our
      themes so that you can make it look the way that you want.  It's
      a powerful application and you're in the driver's seat.

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha4-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Upgradeable Core and Modules </b> - At long last we
	support upgrading from one version of Gallery 2 to the next.
	Unfortunately, this may not work reliably for all version
	before Alpha 4, so we recommend that you reinstall Alpha 4
	from scratch just to be sure.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Uninstall </b> - You can now completely uninstall a
	module and then delete it from your Gallery 2 installation.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer Improvements </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The interface for installing modules is now much easier to
	    use.  It shows you all the modules and lets you select the
	    ones you want to install, and lets you repeat the process
	    as often as you like.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added better instructions and examples for several steps
	    that were confusing (your user feedback at work!)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The installer now works on browsers that don't allow
	    cookies.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Interface enhancements </b> - Some changes in our
	main layout place the most important system links on top of
	every page (Site Admin, Login, Logout, ...). This gives you
	easy access to these commands. The sidebar has some improved
	functionality, like a direct login form and some more details
	on your cart and members (if those modules are active). This
	is another step towards a "block" system where modules can
	provide any amount of blocks of information to be placed in
	the sidebar.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Navigation </b> - It's now easier to navigate around Gallery.
	Meaningful "back" links will bring you back to the last
	visited pages, e.g. it's now possible to visit the Site Admin
	while editing an album and have an easy way to return.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Random Highlight </b> - New module allows albums to
	periodically change highlight, selecting randomly from
	the album's items.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> WebCam </b> - New module creates items that
	periodically refresh the image from an external URL.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Page </b> - New module gives more control
	over thumbnails for movies and documents.  For multipage
	documents (like PDF/Postscript) or images (like multiscene
	TIFF) you can pick the page number for the thumbnail (Note:
	PDF/Postscript require both ImageMagick and Ghostscript).
	When used in conjunction with the Ffmpeg module you can
	pick a time offset for generating thumbnails for movies.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Graphics Toolkits </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The ImageMagick and NetPBM toolkits have been optimized
	    to make fewer calls to external binaries when used for
	    multiple operations.  For example, cropping and resizing
	    to make a thumbnail now requires only a single call to
	    "convert" with ImageMagick.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve extra operations (like crop settings) on
	    thumbnails when moving an item between albums or
	    rebuilding thumbnails.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added ability to set toolkit priority.  This means you
	    can activate multiple toolkits to support more mime types
	    but still select which toolkit is used in cases where
	    multiple toolkits support the same type.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added support for ImageMagick 6.1.x
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Sort Order </b> - "Default sort order" and "Manual sort
	order" are now separate choices, allowing albums to properly
	inherit the site default for sort order; Ascending/descending
	is disabled for these choices.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New Items </b> - New module shows "new" and "updated"
	images next to appropriate images and albums, and adds a new
	sort where new items are shown first followed by other items
	sorted by view count.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> SMTP Authentication </b> - We now support sending email
	via a SMTP server that requires user authentication.  Any
	module that sends email (like the registration module) can
	take advantage of this support.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Embedding Gallery 2 </b> - We've made great improvements in
	embedding Gallery 2 into other applications.  We've
	successfully (though not completely) embedded it into Xaraya
	and have begun working on other platforms.  See
	<a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Embedding"
	target="_blank">Gallery 2 Embedding</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Creation </b> - We now let you create thumbnails
	at upload time, which greatly improves performance the first
	time you view an album.  It's optional, but on by default.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Improved Error Pages </b> - We now show you a nice error
	page when two simultaneous and conflicting changes happen.
	This new page explains how to resolve the problem.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - We now show a list of the recent
	changes that a user has made, and let you page through the
	entire list of changes.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Removed IE7 </b> - We were experimenting with
	<a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  However we
	were not able to get the performance and reliability that we
	needed so we've decided to abandon using it (at least for now).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - Gallery 2 is now translated into 18 languages, though only
	German, Danish and Swedish are over 50% translated.  We can
	use your help!
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha3-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Watermark Support </b> - We now support image
	watermarking.  You can add a watermark to the thumbnail,
	resize or full sized version of an image using a DHTML
	drag-and-drop interface.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Oracle Database Support </b> - The installer now offers
	Oracle (version 9i and higher) among the supported database types.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Manifests </b> - All modules now come with a
	manifest file, and the installer checks to make sure that
	you&rsquo;ve got a complete set of files on the server.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Auto Completion </b> - the Site Admin user and groups
	pages, and the permissions pages now perform appropriate
	completion for you.  Just type a few characters of the
	username you&rsquo;re searching for and it&rsquo;ll give you up to 10
	possible matches.  Tested on Firefox, but not extensively
	tested on IE yet.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New version of IE7 </b> - We&rsquo;re experimenting with
	<a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  The older
	version caused weird problems with images getting overlaid
	with a red X, or IE6 crashing.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Migration improvements </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    We now properly migrate item owners
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve the order of imported subalbums
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Gallery 1 summary and description fields are now
	    transposed on import so that the Gallery 1 "summary"
	    (which was shown inside the album itself) is now the
	    Gallery 2 "description" and vice versa.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> CMS Integration </b> - Although this is not yet readily visible, a
	great deal of work has been done on getting Gallery 2 ready to integrate into
	external content management systems.  We&rsquo;ve successfully done partial
	integrations with <a href="http://www.xaraya.com/" target="_blank">Xaraya</a> and
	<a href="http://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, with more on the way.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - We fixed a noticeable bug where
	the first time you viewed a square thumbnail it might appear
	distorted (this was mentioned in the "known bugs" list of the
	alpha-2 release).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Zip Cart Plugin </b> - You can now download the contents
	of your cart as a zip file.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Albums </b> - You can use the new User Albums module
	to automatically create a new album for a user whenever you
	create a new user.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer </b> - Many minor tweaks including adding more
	install checks to make sure that your system is OK.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - The members module now has privacy settings
	so that you can prevent the unauthorized from seeing your list
	of members, and/or their email addresses.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!
      </li>

      You can choose from four different packages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Minimal</b> - The base application, 2 themes and 3 graphics toolkits and only English
	installed. Everything you need to publish photos, and nothing more.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Typical</b> - The base application, 8 themes and a selection of popular
	modules.  Enough to satisfy the demands of most Gallery users.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Typical-en</b> - Same as <b>Typical</b> except the only language included is English.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Full</b> - The base application, 9 themes and 68 modules.  Every cool
	feature we've got.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Full-en</b> - Same as <b>Full</b> except the only language installed is english.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Developer</b> - Same as the full package, except it includes all the
	developer tools so that you can work on improving the code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You get to pick and choose which modules you activate, so even if you download
      a package that has more modules than you need you can always choose not to
      activate the ones you don't want.  You can also activate a module and test it
      out for a while, then later deactivate and uninstall it.  You can also delete
      any modules/themes that you're not using if you want to save space.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our modules and themes are available separately so if you install a
      smaller package you can still add more functionality later on, either by
      downloading yourself or using the Downloadable Plugins feature in the Site Admin section.

	<b><a name="get_latest_code">Latest Version</a></b> -
	There are four ways to get the code.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Tarball</b> - You can download a prepackaged file as a

	    give the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Preinstaller"
	    target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a> a try. It transfers the archive
	    directly to your webserver and extracts it for you.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>Nightly Snapshot</b> - You can download a tarball or zip file with
	    a snapshot of the most recent code.  Find links to these on the

	    <b>Subversion</b> - This is a better way to get the latest code,
	    but it&rsquo;s for <i>advanced</i> users.  Follow the
	    <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery:Using_Subversion"
	      target="_blank">Subversion instructions</a> to obtain the latest Gallery 2
	    code.  It&rsquo;s easier to stay up to date with this method since
	    you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store
	photos.  This must be writeable by the web server, but for
	security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web
	root.  If you put it in the web root, then anybody can get
	directly to your images with their web browser which
	circumvents Gallery 2&rsquo;s security.
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Unix Example</h3>
	  <p>
	    $ cd $HOME <br/>
	    $ mkdir g2data <br/>
	    $ chmod 777 g2data
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Windows Example</h3>
	  <p>
	    C:\&gt; mkdir g2data
	  </p>
	</div>

	In the Unix example, you may note that modes of 777 on your
	<strong>g2data</strong> directory are not all that secure.
	However, making it more secure depends on how your system is
	configured.  Talk with your system administrator about ways to
	change the permissions on that directory to make it so that
	Gallery can still write to the files but that others
	can&rsquo;t.  Refer to the <a
	href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Security">Gallery
	2 Security Guide</a> for more information.

	The databases most commonly used with Gallery 2 are MySQL and PostgreSQL.
	MySQL is generally faster than PostgreSQL.
	We require you to create the database yourself.
	In our examples below, we&rsquo;ll be creating a database called
	<b>gallery2</b>.  You can use any database name that you
	choose. <br />
	Grant all required <strong>privileges</strong> to your database user. This includes but
	is not confined to: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE in the gallery2 database;
	SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all (gallery2) tables in the gallery2 database;
	CREATE INDEX and some other privileges that are specific to the different database
	management systems.  CREATE/DROP DATABASE and the ability to GRANT privileges to other
	database users are not required.

	target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>, <a href="http://php.net/gd"
	target="_blank">GD</a> or <a
	href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/"
	target="_blank">GraphicsMagick</a>).  You need to activate at
	least one or you won't get any thumbnails, but there's no
	limit on how many you can have.  In fact, more is better
	because they can work together.  Here are some interesting
	points about the main supported toolkits (mostly reported by
	users, your mileage may vary).

	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Fastest</b> - ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>Highest Quality</b> - NetPBM (ImageMagick is a close second though)
	  </li>
	</ul>

	Limitations:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>GD</b> - cannot do image rotation, may hit server
	    memory limits and crash PHP.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>NetPBM, ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick</b> - require server to support exec() system

    <h2><a name="installing">Installing</a></h2>
    <p class="toc-link"> <a href="#toc">[table of contents]</a> </p>
    <p>
      Gallery 2 is a web application and must be installed on your web
      server in order for you to use it.  If you've unpacked it on
      your desktop, you will have to upload it to your server as part
      of the install process.  Then you can configure it using your web browser.<br/>
      As an alternative to the lengthy upload via FTP, take a look at the
      <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Preinstaller"
      target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a>.
    </p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0.2em">
      <li>
	<b> Upload </b> - Copy the Gallery 2 files to a directory on your webserver. There are
	several alternatives for this step:
	<ul style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0">
	  <li>
	    <b>Fastest way</b>: Upload the gallery package to your web
	    server archive via FTP or another method, then unpack it
	    using an interactive shell session (e.g. ssh or telnet).
	    Example unpacking commands (choose the appropriate one):
	    <div class="instructions">
	      <h3> For .tar.gz archives </h3>
	      <p>
		$ tar xzf gallery2.tar.gz
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="instructions">
	      <h3> For zip archives </h3>
	      <p>
		$ unzip gallery2.zip
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    If you do not have shell access, you can ask your provider
	    to do it for you, or you can make a miniature PHP script
	    containing one of the above commands.  Some webhosting
	    companies offer a control panel with a web file-browser
	    which is capable of extracting / unarchiving archive
	    files. It&rsquo;s worth a try to check if this option is
	    available.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <b>Easiest (but slowest) way:</b> If you don't have shell
	    access, you can upload the complete contents of the
	    Gallery 2 archive to the webserver with an FTP
	    program. This may take a lot of time and be
	    error-prone. In this case, pay special attention to the
	    &rsquo;System Checks&rsquo; step of the installer and make
	    sure that there are no missing or modified files.
	    Consider using a smart FTP program like
	    <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> to
	    make sure that your transfer goes smoothly.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <b>Advanced way</b>: The best way to install Gallery
	    <b>and</b> stay up to date if you have shell access to
	    your webserver is to use
	    <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery:Using_Subversion"
	      target="_blank">Subversion</a>.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<b> Note: </b> After uploading, you should close this version
	of the README and browse to the version that you just
	uploaded.  That way all the links in this document will point
	to the right places in your Gallery 2 install.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Begin Installing </b> - Open up your web browser and browse to the
	<a href="install/index.php" target="_guided">install directory</a>.
	Gallery 2 will walk you through the process of validating that your system
	is properly configured and will set everything up for you.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Authenticate </b> - You will be asked to create and save a
	small text file in order to authenticate.  You may not proceed
	until you do this.  That&rsquo;s how Gallery 2 knows that you&rsquo;re authorized
	to use the installer.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Checks </b> - The installer checks your system to
	make sure that it will support Gallery 2. Make sure that all
	checks are successful!
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Installation Type </b> - Gallery can support multiple independent sites with
	a single installation of the code.  Here you will select a standard single install
	or the location of a new multisite install. There is more information about multisite
	in the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Multisite"
	target="_blank">Gallery Codex</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Storage Setup </b> - Read the instructions on the
	installer to set up a storage location for Gallery 2.  This is
	where Gallery 2 will store all of your images, as well as other cache
	information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Database Setup </b> - Select your database type and enter
	your database authentication information. If this is not your first Gallery 2 installation
	and there are still some remains of the old installation, it will check the state of the
	installed version and offer a clean install option which will delete all your data in the
	storage directory and in the database. If the installed version  seems to be fine, it will
	also offer to reuse the existing database tables. Select this option if you did not start
	the installer with the intent to start from scratch.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Admin User Setup </b> - You are prompted for an
	administrator username and password. Type in a password and
	type it again to validate it. The full name and the email address are optional.
	But entering an email address is highly recommended. Once you&rsquo;re finished,
	 click &rsquo;Create&rsquo; to create the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Create Config File </b> - Gallery 2 will create the
	<b>config.php</b> file in your Gallery 2 directory.  This contains
	all the answers you&rsquo;ve provided in the installer and is
	necessary for Gallery 2 to function properly. At this point, there&rsquo;s also a sanity
	check to prevent you from damaging your Gallery install by running the installer when you
	should rather have started the upgrader.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install the Core module </b> - Here&rsquo;s where we create all
	the database tables and initial users and albums to get you
	started.  Unless something goes wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing for you
	to do here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install other modules </b> - Gallery 2 has lots of different
	modules that provide useful functionality.  Choose which ones
	you want to use.  You can always go to the <a href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin"
	target="_guided">Site Admin</a> page later on to install, activate, deactivate or
	uninstall modules, so it&rsquo;s ok to experiment here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Check Security </b> - Gallery 2 walks you through the process of
	locking down your new <b>config.php</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Finished! </b> - Congratulations! You have successfully
	installed Gallery 2!

      <h3> Warning When Upgrading from Gallery 2.0! </h3>
      <p>
	Third party modules and themes designed for Gallery 2.0 will

    <ol>
      <li>
	If you have a busy site, consider putting your Gallery in
	maintenance mode before updating the code and performing the
	upgrade. This gives visitors a message that the site is
	temporarily offline, rather than showing everybody the upgrade
	page. Edit your config.php file to activate maintenance mode.
	This feature is new starting in 2.1, so it is not available in
	an upgrade from 2.0.x.
      </li>

      <li>
	Download the latest code for any active third party modules
	that you're using, or deactivate them.  If in doubt,
	deactivating is safe.
      </li>

      <li>
	<a href="#get_latest_code">Get the latest code</a> and unpack
	it over your existing copy of Gallery 2. Keep your existing
	config.php in place, and don't touch your (g2data) data folder
	or the database.  If you're using Subversion, you can just do
	"svn update" at any time. Alternatively, you can also use the
	<a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Preinstaller"
	target="_blank">Gallery 2 Pre-Installer</a> to get the latest code
	onto the webserver.
      </li>

      <li>
	If you use a PHP accelerator / cache (e.g. Turk mmCache,
	Ioncube PHPA, eaccelerator, Zend Studio, etc.), flush (clear)
	the cache of the accelerator.  Omitting this step can
	<i>sometimes</i> lead to errors during and after the upgrade process.
      </li>

      <li>
	Browse to <a href="upgrade/index.php" target="_guided">the
	upgrader</a> and follow the instructions there.  <b>Make a
	backup of your data</b> (g2data folder and especially the
	database) when it tells you to!  Should you lose your data due

      <b> Unit Tests </b> - Gallery 2 was designed using <a
      href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming"
      target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a> methodologies.  This
      means that we have over 2,000 unit tests that ensure code
      quality.  If you want to help us out, you can <a
      href="lib/tools/phpunit/index.php" target="_guided">try running
      the unit tests</a> and report back to us if any of them fail.
      <br/>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 0 10px">
      <b> Note </b> - these tests shouldn&rsquo;t change your Gallery
      2 settings at all, but if they fail, they may leave things in a
      weird state.  Be warned that there's a slim chance that you
      might have to ditch your Gallery 2 data and start over if
      something catastrophic happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> For Themers </b> - There is now some
      <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Themes" target="_guided">theme documentation</a>
      that you should read if you want to change the look of your Gallery 2 by customizing
      an existing theme and its templates or by creating your own theme.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Localization </b> - If you&rsquo;re interested in localizing
      Gallery 2 into another language, you can
      <a href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php"
      target="_guided">review the current state of localization</a>
      and then <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Localization"
      target="_guided">read the localization how-to</a> and get started.
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse"
      target="_guided">Submit your localizations</a> early and often -
      no need to wait until you&rsquo;re entirely done.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> For Developers </b> - We've gotten started on some
      <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/dev"
      target="_guided">developer documentation</a> that you should read if you want to
      start hacking on Gallery 2.  Some of the information is a little bit out of date
      or in early drafts, but it's a start.
    </p>
