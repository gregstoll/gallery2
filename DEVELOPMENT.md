# Branches

* `dev/*` branches: branches that are intended for new code to be integrated on the upstream repository via PR.

# Development environment

# Unit testing

Run unit testing by navigating to the following URL:
```text
http://SITE_ADDRESS/lib/tools/phpunit/index.php
```

To run any test, write the name of the module on the input box and hit `ENTER` (there is no form button).

## Launch test from command line

You will need to set two environment variables for the authentication:

* `USERNAME`, use the username you use for login on the admin panel.
* `PASSWORD`, use the password for the user.

This script assumes that you use the same password for the admin user and for the `setup.password`
to access the support area.

For example:
```shell
$ export USERNAME=admin
$ export PASSWORD=myadminpassword

$ grep "setup.password" config.php
...
$gallery->setConfig('setup.password', 'myadminpassword');
...
```

There is a helper script to run tests:
```shell
auto-test.sh <SERVER_URL> <SCOPE>
```

* `SERVER_URL` is the server URL as in `http://host.docker.internal:10000/`.
* `SCOPE` is a regular expression string to restrict testing to classes containing that text
in their class name or test method. If you use an exclamation before a module/class/test
name(s) encapsulated in parenthesis and separated with bars,
this will exclude the matching tests. Use "`:#-#`" to restrict which matching tests are
actually run. You can also specify multiple spans with "`:#-#,#-#,#-#`". Append "`:1by1`"
to run tests one-per-request; automatic refresh stops when a test fails.
```text
    AddCommentControllerTest.testAddComment
    AddCommentControllerTest.testAdd
    AddCommentControllerTest
    comment
    !(comment)
    !(comment|core)
    comment:1-3
    comment:3-
    comment:-5
    comment:1-3,6-8,10-12
    comment:-3,4-
    core:1by1
```

## Test results

As the test progress, you will see the number of the latest test executed, like this:
```text
testRow1
testRow2
testRow3
...
testRow15
testRow16
...
```
At the end you will see a report available on the name of the scope you selected, with `html`
extension. You can open it on a browser to see more details on the execution.


# Docker

There is a docker compose configuration that will run nginx web server, PHP-FPM server and MySQL server.

In order to start it run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Initial setup

Point your browser to `http://host.docker.internal:10000/install.php` and follow the instructions.

Use `/gallery2-data` on the Storage setup step. Make sure the directory is writable, since when initially
created it will not allow writing.

```shell
$ docker exec -it gallery2-php8-php-1 bash -c "chmod a+w /gallery2-data"
```

You will find mysql credentials in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. Use `mysql` for the server hostname.


## Configuration

Add the following configuration to `config.php` file:

```php
$gallery->setConfig('baseUri', 'http://host.docker.internal:10000/main.php');
```

This way you will be able to access the web server running on docker, and at the same time, you will be
able to debug the code.

## Locale files

Some unit tests require translation files for the core module.

In order to facilitate the initial setup, there is a script at `lib/tools/phpunit/create-locale.sh` to
create the files in the appropriate location.

In order to use your locale in the docker image, you need to add it to `PHP.Dockerfile`. This is an example
for `ca_ES` locale. Add a line like it using your locale:
```shell
    && sed -i -e 's/# ca_ES ISO-8859-1/ca_ES ISO-8859-1/' /etc/locale.gen \
```

# Release management

Tools for release management are on folder `lib/tools/release`.

# Translation tools

Tools for release management are on folder `lib/tools/po`.

See further details at [Gallery2 Codex](http://codex.galleryproject.org/Gallery2:Localization.html).

# Disable Xdebug on docker

Start docker-composer using a variable to control PHP base image, `PHP_TARGET`:

* do not set it or set it to `base` to use a PHP version with no Xdebug.
* set it to `debug`, to use a PHP version with Xdebug.

Whenever you would like to switch from base to debug, you should build the php service:

Example to activate debug:

```shell
export PHP_TARGET=debug

docker compose down && \
  docker compose build php && \
  docker compose restart php
```

Example to disable debug:

```shell
export PHP_TARGET=base

docker compose down && \
  docker compose build php && \
  docker compose restart php
```
